                <p>Sun Rise Resorts was founded in 2000. Our founder William Lanmark was exploring this very location and stumbled open the most beautiful view. Lanmark instantly wanted to make it safe heaven. His visions went farther than that and we ended up with the Sun Rise resorts.
                    <br><br>
                    Since then the resort has grown and has expanded. With the expansion, we have also updated our services to accommodate our customers. It is our mission to uphold the expectation set by our founder to make this place a worry-free, relaxing vacation spot for all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our resort is a place for the entire family. We provide activities for adults and kids. Our goal has been and still is our customers' enjoyment. We hope you have a  worry-free and fun time here.
